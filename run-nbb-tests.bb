#!/usr/bin/env bb
;; Runs this repo's test suite through nbb (Node Babashka -- a SCI-interpreted
;; ClojureScript environment, no build step) as a genuine 3rd platform tier
;; alongside JVM (`clojure -M:test`) and self-hosted cljs (`npm run
;; test:cljs`). Auto-discovers every `*_test.cljc` under test/ (same
;; -test$-suffix convention shadow-cljs.edn's `:ns-regexp "-test$"` already
;; assumes) and resolves the classpath from `clojure -Spath`, filtered to
;; directories only (jars are JVM-only; nbb can't load them) -- the same
;; approach gen-shadow-cljs-edn.bb already uses for the cljs build, so nbb
;; tests against the exact pinned deps.edn dependencies too, not a
;; hand-duplicated list that can drift.
;;
;; Exit code is wired through cljs.test's :end-run-tests report hook (NOT a
;; naive "parse the printed summary text" heuristic) -- `nbb`'s own process
;; only exits non-zero if this namespace explicitly calls `js/process.exit`,
;; since a failed `is` assertion is just printed output, not a thrown
;; exception; without this hook every CI failure here would silently report
;; success.
